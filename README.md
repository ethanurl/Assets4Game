# Assets4Game
This is my d1 project.
I fulfill the 8 requirements like this:
There are 5 distinct scenes
I used 3 audio assets, 1 for the loading screen, 1 for the 'pizzaman' fight, and 1 for the title music
I used 5 image assets, and 4 of them had a transparent background. The opening slide, loading slide, 2 on the pizza fight, and the title screen
I used 2 geometric shapes, a rectangle and a circle, both were used on the pizzaman scene
I made text on both the first and second scenes, as well as the text for the title screen
I made a multi-line text with the "click to continue" as well as the text screen
I had a fade to black on the first screen
I had object motion animation with the loading screen and the pizzaman fight
